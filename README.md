Conspiracy theorists frequently cite symbols such as the **All-Seeing Eye** and **pyramids** as evidence of the Illuminati’s influence. These symbols are often shared in aesthetic images on Pinterest, gaining attention.

## **2. Community Building**
Using Pinterest boards, users curate collections of images and symbols, reinforcing their belief in the Illuminati. These curated spaces can serve as **echo chambers**, amplifying the reach of conspiracy theories.

### Example Layout:

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Khafre_statue.jpg" alt="Pyramid of Khafre" width="300" height="300" />
  <p style="padding-left: 20px;">Many boards feature curated collections of symbols and imagery like this pyramid.</p>

## **3. Echo Chambers on Pinterest**
As users pin more Illuminati-related content, Pinterest’s algorithm recommends similar content. This creates a feedback loop, pushing users deeper into conspiratorial content without exposure to fact-checking or opposing viewpoints.




<blockquote>
  "Once a user starts pinning conspiracy theories, Pinterest’s recommendations reinforce the narrative, turning their feed into an echo chamber."
</blockquote>
